\title{Upload into a new Drive file}
\usage{
drive_upload(media, path = NULL, name = NULL, type = NULL, ...,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{media}{Character, path to the local file to upload.}

\item{path}{Specifies target destination for the new file on Google
Drive. Can be an actual path (character), a file id marked with
\code{\link{as_id}()}, or a \code{\link{dribble}}. If specified as an
actual path, it is best to explicitly indicate if it's a folder by
including a trailing slash, since it cannot always be worked out from the
context of the call. Will default to its local name.}

\item{name}{Character, new file name if not specified as part of
\code{path}. This will force \code{path} to be treated as a folder, even if
it is character and lacks a trailing slash. Will default to its local name.}

\item{type}{Character. If \code{type = NULL}, a MIME type is automatically
determined from the file extension, if possible. If the source file is of a
suitable type, you can request conversion to Google Doc, Sheet or Slides by
setting \code{type} to \code{document}, \code{spreadsheet}, or \code{presentation},
respectively. All non-\code{NULL} values for \code{type} are pre-processed with
\code{\link[=drive_mime_type]{drive_mime_type()}}.}

\item{...}{Named parameters to pass along to the Drive API. You can affect
the metadata of the target file by specifying properties of the Files
resource via \code{...}. See the "Request body" section of the Drive API
docs for the associated endpoint.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, indicating whether to print informative messages
(default \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{dribble}}, a tibble with one row per
  item.
}
\description{
Uploads a local file into a new Drive file. To update the content or metadata
of an existing Drive file, use \code{\link[=drive_update]{drive_update()}}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
## upload a csv file
chicken_csv <- drive_upload(
  drive_example("chicken.csv"),
  "chicken-upload.csv"
)

## or convert it to a Google Sheet
chicken_sheet <- drive_upload(
  drive_example("chicken.csv"),
  name = "chicken-sheet-upload.csv",
  type = "spreadsheet"
)

## check out the new Sheet!
drive_browse(chicken_sheet)

## clean-up
drive_find("chicken.*upload") \%>\% drive_rm()

## Upload a file and, at the same time, star it
chicken <- drive_upload(
  drive_example("chicken.jpg"),
  starred = "true"
)

## Is is really starred? YES
purrr::pluck(chicken, "drive_resource", 1, "starred")

## Clean up
drive_rm(chicken)
